        <strong>Summary:</strong> Background Remover Pro processes your images on your device.
        We do not collect personal information for advertising, and we do not sell your data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>What data we collect</h2>
    <p>
      Background Remover Pro does not require an account and does not collect personal information such as your name,
      email address, phone number, or precise location.
    </p>

    <h2>Photos and image processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Images you select are processed on-device to remove or blur backgrounds.</li>
      <li>Your photos are not uploaded by the app as part of normal operation.</li>
      <li>Any exported images are saved where you choose (for example, Photos or Files) using iOS system features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Payments and subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Purchases (including subscriptions and lifetime unlocks) are handled by Apple through StoreKit and the App Store.
      We do not receive your full payment details. Apple may process information required to complete transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics and tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Background Remover Pro does not use third-party advertising SDKs and does not track you across apps and websites.
      If you choose to share diagnostic information with Apple (e.g., crash reports), Apple may provide us aggregated,
      non-identifying reports to help improve app stability.
    </p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      If the app supports optional notifications, they are delivered by iOS. You can manage notification permissions
      in iOS Settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      Any app settings or local data are stored on your device. You can remove the app to delete its local data.
      Exported files you saved to Photos/Files remain there until you delete them.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Background Remover Pro is not designed to collect personal information from children. If you believe a child
      has provided personal information through the app, please contact us so we can address it.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” at the top will reflect the latest version.
